When they started working on Kotlin, instead of keeping it as an internal project, they opted to open-source it. As of now Kotlin doesn’t profit from developers who use the language but it expects to make money from its Kotlin supporting core products. Kotlin has benefitted immensely from the feedback from big Java community and from being open sourced."

But a legend has it that Gosling and his gang of programmers went out to the local cafe to discuss names and ended up naming it Java. There seems to be some truth in this as the 0xCafeBabe magic number in the class files was named after the Cafe where the Java team used to go for coffee."

A majority of websites use it and all major web browsers have a devoted JavaScript engine to execute it.JavaScript is single threaded. This is the reason lots of people who use multi-threaded programming thinks its working is slow as it would not be able to make use of all the cores of the CPU properly."

It’s powered by the open-source platform Zend Engine, and can either be embedded directly into HTML or used in content management systems (CMS) or web frameworks. While most webmasters and programmers have a basic understanding of PHP and how it works, we’re going to explore some of the fun, lesser-known facts surrounding it."
